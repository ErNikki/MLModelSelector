# Net Selector

##  Descriprition

Use of reinforcement learning algorithms, such as double q learning and policy gradient, through which an agent can be trained to orchestrate machine learning models.
The agent's task is to act as an orchestrator of machine learning models. The agent, once it receives an input image, is tasked with selecting the best machine learning model through which to make the prediction.
The main goal is to optimize the inference time, reducing it compared to ensemble methods, while improving the overall accuracy of the predictions.
